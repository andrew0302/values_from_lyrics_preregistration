Study Title: Song Lyrics and the Values they express

We're interested in the values expressed in different song lyrics! 

Following a definition by Schwartz, we interpret values as the guiding principles of one's life. In this study, we'll be asking you to read song lyrics and tell us what values you think are being expressed. Some songs are more difficult to interpet than others, so we'll also be asking about how confident you are in your responses, and why you think that is. In the case that people who generally are interested in lyrics give different responses, we'll also ask some questions about how involved you are with song lyrics. 

These lyrics are from a large general pool of song lyrics, and may contain offensive language or describe offensive situations. 

We estimate rewards will be sent between 1 and 3 working days after we close our survey.
