I'm pretty confident.   All music is about expression.  I'd go one step further and suggest that all art is about expression.   Artists, generally want attention.   I truly think that there's an element of desiring power, and achievement-seeking, in all art.   Art is absolutely about hedonism.    It's certainly about stimulation.  All art is meant to draw a reaction.   I've never met an artist that doesn't desire self-direction.   I think universalism is a little relative, the same with benevolence.   I think there's an element of tradition, in all art, because every artist tends to draw on what came before them.  All artists take inspiration from something else.   Art is typically unrelated to conformity.  And I think most artists are seeking some form of security.    And not trying to be overly long winded, but this is Prolific, so I wanted to justify everything, at least once."
