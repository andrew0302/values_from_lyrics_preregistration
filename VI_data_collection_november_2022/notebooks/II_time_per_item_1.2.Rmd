#AIM

The aim of this notebook is to examine how long it took to answer the items on the lyrics questionnaire, and to complete each set of questions for each song lyric.

```

Both prolific and qualtrics have their own measures of time taken for the entire survey. Here I take a look at each of them. 

```{r}
responses_dt <- all_dt

#rename qualtrics duration column
responses_dt$duration <- as.numeric(responses_dt$`Duration (in seconds)`) 

#define columns to plot
columns <- c("duration", "PROLIFIC_PID", "Time taken", "Sex", "Age")

#plot survey duration according to qualtrics
duration_plot <- responses_dt %>% select(columns) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=duration, y=Age, color=Sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Time (in seconds): Qualtrics") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1000, 7000))

#plot survey duration according to prolific
time_taken_plot <- responses_dt[!Sex=='CONSENT REVOKED'] %>% .[`Time taken` < 100000] %>%select(columns) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=`Time taken`, y=Age, color=Sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Time (in seconds): Prolific") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1000, 7000))

grid.arrange(duration_plot, time_taken_plot, ncol=1)

rm(duration_plot, time_taken_plot, columns)
```

```{r}
outliers_dt <- responses_dt[, c("PROLIFIC_PID", "Time taken", "duration")]
outliers_dt <- outliers_dt[`Time taken`>5000 | duration>5000]

outliers_dt <- merge(outliers_dt, all_dt, by="PROLIFIC_PID")

rm(outliers_dt)
```
Here I select rows that have the timing information for each of the questions. Specifically, I select rows with that contain a) the first click on the page, and b) the last click on the page. I then subtract the first click time from the last click time to get the time spent on the page. 

According to: https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/timing/, the time is in seconds. 

```{r}
# logical vector of matches to: 
# 1) either first or last click for a question
# 2) participant ID
clicks <- grepl("First.Click|Last.Click|PROLIFIC_PID", colnames(responses_dt)) 

#subset data based on clicks vector
clicks_dt <- responses_dt[, ..clicks]

#pivot to a long format
clicks_dt <- melt(clicks_dt, id.vars=c("PROLIFIC_PID"))

## separate long dt into two shorter dts:

# dt with only rows with "Last Click"
last <- clicks_dt[variable %like% "Last Click"]
# remove 'Last.Click'
last$variable <- last$variable %>% gsub("Last.Click", "", .)
# change name of column
setnames(last, "value", "last_click")
# make column numeric
last$last_click <- as.numeric(last$last_click)
  
# dt with only rows with "First Click"
first <- clicks_dt[variable %like% "First Click"] 
# remove 'First.Click'
first$variable <- first$variable %>% gsub("First.Click", "", .)
# change name of column 
setnames(first, "value", "first_click")
# make column numeric
first$first_click <- as.numeric(first$first_click)

#merge two smaller dts
both <- first[last, on = .(PROLIFIC_PID, variable)]

#compute difference
both[, diff := (last_click - first_click)]

rm(first, last, clicks_dt, clicks, responses_dt)
```

Here I plot the time taken in seconds for each question block. 
Two observations appear to be clear outliers. 

One observation took 9000+ seconds - it may be a timeout issue, or perhaps the person managed to stay logged in while away from the computer. 

```{r}
time_taken_table <- both |> 
  group_by(variable) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(diff, na.rm=T), median = median(diff, na.rm=T), sd = sd(diff, na.rm=T))
```

```{r}




```


```{r}
time_per_song_plot <- both %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x=diff, y=variable, color = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Time taken (In seconds)")

time_per_song_plot
```
Here I table the time taken per observation in descending order:

```{r}
both[order(-diff),]
```

Here I filter out the initial lyrics questionnaire and estimate central tendency of the time taken per lyric. 

```{r}
no_outliers_removed <- both |>
  filter(variable != "Lyric_questions_time_") |>
  summarize(mean = mean(diff, na.rm=T), median = median(diff, na.rm=T), sd = sd(diff, na.rm=T))

outliers_less_than_900 <- both[diff<900] |>
  filter(variable != "Lyric_questions_time_") |>
  summarize(mean = mean(diff), median=median(diff), sd = sd(diff))

central_tendency <- rbind(no_outliers_removed, outliers_less_than_900)
central_tendency$outliers <- c("no outliers removed", "outliers set at < 900")
central_tendency <- central_tendency |> select(outliers, everything())
central_tendency

rm(no_outliers_removed, outliers_less_than_900, central_tendency)
```


```{r}
#these look like outliers. when removed the values look more normal
both[variable=='55713838-m_',][diff<9000] %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff))

both[variable=='2241308-m_',][diff<2000] %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff))

both[variable=='205113268-m_',][diff<900]  %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff))
```

To more closely examine whether older people take more time, I plot the time taken variable against age:

```{r}
both <- both[demogs_dt[, c("Sex", "age", "PROLIFIC_PID")], on=.(PROLIFIC_PID)]

both[diff<1000] |>
  filter(variable != "Lyric_questions_time_") |>
  ggplot(aes(x=diff, y=age, color=Sex)) +
  geom_point()

rm(demogs_dt)
```

Although there's no reason to expect sex differences I plot them anyway:
```{r}
both[diff<900] %>% ggplot(aes(x=diff, color=Sex, fill=Sex)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~Sex)

both[diff<900] %>% ggplot(aes(x=diff)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(diff)), color="red") +
  annotate(geom="text", x=200, y=4000, label="Median = 31.8") +
  xlab("Time (in seconds")
```

Here I build a data table of the mean time taken per question block, excluding outliers defined as > 900 seconds. 

```{r}
summary_dt <- both %>% group_by(variable) %>% summarize(mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff)) %>% ungroup()

#compute mean and sd seconds per lyric stimulus
summary_dt[1:20,] %>% summarize(mean = mean(mean), sd=mean(sd))

#create summary statistics dt by questionnaire section
summary_dt <- both[diff<900] %>% group_by(variable) %>% summarize(mean = mean(diff), sd = sd(diff)) %>% ungroup()

#make data table
setDT(summary_dt)

summary_dt
```

Song # 151085454

"I think cancers gonna kill me 
'Cause I got a real bad sunburn when I was 13
 Couldn't sit in a classroom chair for at least a week
 Maybe I shouldn't have fallen asleep
 In that hot, hot sun without a little bit of sunscreen
 Don't let this reflect too badly on my character
 I think a car is gonna kill me 'cause
 I Ride my bike consistently throughout the city
 And we all know, it's only so long before you get hit"
 

Song # 99567690

"Hey guy - you're the one for me 
 Your face - the sweetest thing I've ever seen 
 Stop by - dedicate to me 
 Your time - your time 
 At night - it really gets to me 
 I find nobody is here with me 
 Stop by - say you'll stay with me 
 You're the one I really miss 
 Every single day - single hour 
 I can see your face - single day"


A conservative estimate for the time it takes to complete the lyrics block is 190 seconds (M=105.47, SD=84).

The lyrics items look rather uniform in terms of time taken. I display the two with the highest values above. 
 
```{r}
summary_dt[order(-mean),]
summary_dt[order(-sd),]
```

More interactive visualization below:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Time Taken by Song (in seconds)"),
  
  #plot this thing called 'alpha_plot'
  plotOutput('both_plot'),
  
  #tableOutput('alpha_table')
  DT::DTOutput('both')
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  
  # render the plots; alpha distribution by n
  output$both_plot <- renderPlot({
    both[diff > 0 & diff < 900,] %>% 
    ggplot(., aes(x=diff, y=variable, color = variable)) +
    geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
    theme_minimal() +
    #this adds the label to the title
    labs(title=paste("Time Taken by Song (in seconds)"))
